# What is ransomware

*Ransomware* is a type of cyber security attack that destroys or encrypts files and folders, preventing the owner of the effected device from accessing their data. The cybercriminal can then extort money from the business owner in exchange for a key to unlock the encrypted data. But, even when paid, cybercriminals may not provide the key to return access to the business owner.
