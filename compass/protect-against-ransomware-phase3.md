# Phase 3: Make it hard to get in

In this phase, you make the attackers work a lot harder to get into your on-premises or cloud infrastructures by incrementally removing the risks at the points of entry.

>[!Important]
>While many of these will be familiar and/or easy to quickly accomplish, itâ€™s critically important that **your work on Phase 3 should not slow down your progress on phases 1 and 2**!

## Remote access

Gaining access to your organization's intranet through a remote access connection is an attack vector for ransomware attackers. Once an on-premises user account is compromised, an attacker is free to roam on an intranet to gather intelligence, elevate privileges, and install ransomware code. The recent Colonial Pipeline cyberattack is an example.

Apply these best practices to protect your remote access infrastructure from ransomware attackers.

| Done| Task | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|

| <input type="checkbox" disabled /> | Deploy [Azure VPN gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant#enable-authentication) to provide remote access. | Take advantage of integration with Azure AD and your existing Azure subscriptions. |
| <input type="checkbox" disabled /> | Publish on-premises web apps with [Azure AD Application Proxy](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services). | Apps published with Azure AD Application Proxy do not need a remote access connection. |
| <input type="checkbox" disabled /> | Secure access to Azure resources with [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview). | Securely and seamlessly connect to your Azure virtual machines over SSL. |
| <input type="checkbox" disabled /> | Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)).  |  Reduces risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings. |

### Timeframe and key results

Try to achieve these results within 30-60 days:

- TBD % of remote access connections using zero trust validation
- TBD % of applications published to the Internet with Azure AD Application Proxy
- TBD of VPN connections per month (long-term target is zero)

--> 

## Email and collaboration

Implement best practices for email and collaboration solutions to make it more difficult for attackers to abuse them, while allowing your workers to easily and safely access external content.

Attackers frequently enter the environment by transferring malicious content in with authorized collaboration tools such as email and file sharing and convincing users to run it. Microsoft has invested in enhanced mitigations that vastly increase protection against these attack vectors.

### Implementation results and timelines

Try to achieve these results within 30 days:

- TBD % of computers with all protections enabled

--> 

## Endpoints

Implement relevant security features and rigorously follow software maintenance best practices for computers and applications, prioritizing applications and server/client operating systems directly exposed to Internet traffic and content.

Internet-exposed endpoints are a common entry vector that provides attackers access to the organization's assets. Prioritize blocking common OS and application with preventive controls to slow or stop them from executing the next stages.

## Accounts

Just as antique skeleton keys wonâ€™t protect a house against a modern-day burglar, passwords cannot protect accounts against common attacks we see today. While multi-factor authentication (MFA) was once a burdensome extra step, passwordless approaches today improve the sign-in experience using biometric approaches that donâ€™t require your users to remember or type a password. Additionally, Zero Trust approaches remember trusted devices, which reduce prompting for annoying out-of-band MFA actions.

Starting with high-privilege administrator accounts, rigorously follow these best practices for account security including using passwordless or MFA.
