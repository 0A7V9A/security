# Microsoft Security Best Practices module: Information protection and storage
Intellectual property that is valuable to the organization (or its customers/constituents) requires security protection appropriate to its value.

See the [storage, data, and encryption](#storage-data-encryption.md) and [capabilities](#information-protection-and-storage-capabilities.md) topics for more information.

The following videos provide guidance on information protection and storage. To download the PowerPoint slides associated with these videos, click [download presentation slides](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/downloads/security-compass-presentation.pptx).

For more information about information protection capabilities across Microsoft 365 and SQL databases, see [CISO Workshop Module 5: Information Protection](/security/ciso-workshop/ciso-workshop-module-5) and [Information protection and storage capabilities](information-protection-and-storage-capabilities.md).
