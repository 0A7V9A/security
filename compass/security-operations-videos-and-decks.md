# Microsoft Security Best Practices module: Security operations
Security Operations monitor the enterprise environment to rapidly identify and remediate risk from active attack operations, sharing insights and threat intelligence from these attacks to the rest of the organization.

See the [Security operations](security-operations.md) and [Capabilities](security-operations-capabilities.md) topics for more information.

The following videos provide guidance on security operations. You can also download the [PowerPoint slides](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/downloads/security-compass-presentation.pptx) associated with these videos.
