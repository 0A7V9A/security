# Human-operated ransomware

Human-operated ransomware is a large and growing attack trend that represents a threat to most industries.

Human-operated ransomware is different than commodity ransomware. These “hands-on-keyboard” attacks leverage human attackers’ knowledge of common system and security misconfigurations to infiltrate a compromised network and then adapt to the network and its weak points as they go. Hallmarks of a human-operated ransomware attack typically include credential theft and lateral movement, resulting in deployment of a ransomware payload to any resource the attackers choose.

These attacks can be catastrophic. Only through complete adversary eviction can you protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity ransomware, which only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware will continue to threaten your business operations. 

To better protect your organization, Microsoft recommends that you use the information in the **[Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/5/1/751682ca-5aae-405b-afa0-e4832138e436/RansomwareRecommendations.pptx)** PowerPoint presentation, which includes [securing privileged access](https://aka.ms/spa).

This figure shows how this extortion-based attack that uses privileged access is growing in impact and likelihood:
