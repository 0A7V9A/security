# Human-operated ransomware

Human-operated ransomware is a large and growing attack trend that represents a threat to organizations in every industry.

Human-operated ransomware is different than commodity ransomware. These “hands-on-keyboard” attacks target an organization rather than a single device and leverage human attackers’ knowledge of common system and security misconfigurations to infiltrate the organization, navigate the enterprise network, and adapt to the environment and its weaknesses as they go. 

Hallmarks of these human-operated ransomware attacks typically include credential theft and lateral movement and can result in deployment of a ransomware payload to high business impact resources the attackers choose.

These attacks can be catastrophic to business operations and are difficult to clean up, requiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity ransomware that only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware will continue to threaten your business operations after the initial encounter. 

This figure shows how this extortion-based attack that uses maintenance and security configuration gaps and privileged access is growing in impact and likelihood.

## Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan

To better protect your organization, Microsoft recommends that you use the information in the **[Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/5/1/751682ca-5aae-405b-afa0-e4832138e436/RansomwareRecommendations.pptx)** PowerPoint presentation, which includes [securing privileged access](https://aka.ms/spa).

Here is a summary of the guidance:

![The impact and likelihood that human-operated ransomware attacks will continue](media/human-operated-ransomware/stakes-weaknesses-plan.png)

- The stakes of ransomware and extortion are high
- However, the attacks have weaknesses that can mitigate your likelihood of being attacked
- There are three phases to configure your infrastructure to exploit attack weaknesses

## Rapidly protect against ransomware and extortion

To quickly configure your IT infrastructure for the best protection against a ransomware or extortion attack, see the [Protect your organization against ransomware and extortion](protect-against-ransomware.md) solution. 

This three-phase guidance tells you how to:

1. Prevent a ransomware attacker from obtaining financial leverage.
2. Prevent a ransomware attacker from getting broad access to resources in your environment.
3. Prevent a ransomware attacker from entering your environment.
