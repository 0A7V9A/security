# Human operated ransomware
Human operated ransomware is a large and growing attack trend that represents a threat to most industries.

Human operated ransomware is different than generic, auto-spreading ransomware. Humans adversaries direct the attack to steal credentials and move laterally through networks. These methods combine a ransomware payload with privileged access attacks and are traditionally associated with targeted attacks like those from nation-state actors. Human adversaries use common network security misconfigurations to perform thorough reconnaissance and adapt to what they discover in a compromised network.

The result of a human operated ransomware attack can be severe, and the likelihood that most industries will be affected by such attacks is high.

Human operated ransomware has fueled an explosive growth of highly profitable attacks that intentionally disrupt business operations across many different industries.
