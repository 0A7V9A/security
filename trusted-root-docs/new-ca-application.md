------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Certificate Authority Intake Process

1.  In order to begin the process to be included in the Program, a CA
    must fill out the application located at
    <https://aka.ms/rootcertapply> and email the completed form to
    [msroot\@microsoft.com]. This will begin the onboarding
    process, outlined below:
2.  Microsoft will review the application, and may request additional
    documentation from the CA to determine if the CA meets the Program
    requirements and whether, in Microsoft's judgment, the CA's
    inclusion into the program will benefit Microsoft's customers.
3.  Microsoft will provide preliminary Program approval to the CA and a
    deadline by which all materials must be completed and returned to
    Microsoft, for the CA to in included in the next release (typically
    every four months).
4.  Upon receipt of preliminary approval from Microsoft, the CA will
    need to engage an auditor to complete the necessary audit. See,
    https://aka.ms/auditreqs for more information about the Program's
    audit requirements.
5.  When the audit is complete, the CA must send the following materials
    to Microsoft:
    1.  A copy of all of the roots that the CA wishes to have Microsoft
        include in the Program in .cer file format (contained in a .ZIP
        file)
    2.  Test URLs for each root, or a URL of a publicly accessible
        server that Microsoft can use to verify the certificates.
    3.  An electronic copy or URL that contains the most recent audit
        attestation for each of the roots the CA wishes to have
        Microsoft include in the Program
    4.  Information to complete and sign the Program contract,
        including:

    -   The name, email address, phone number, and job title of the
        person who will sign the Program contract
    -   A second contact's name, email address, and phone number.
    -   The company's principle place of business (street address).
    -   The company's place of incorporation (country or
        state/province).

6.  Microsoft will send the Program contract to the CA to sign and
    return to Microsoft.
7.  Upon receipt of the completed contract, Microsoft will add the CA to
    the next release, if the CA has returned the materials by the
    deadline provided to the CA. Otherwise, Microsoft will add the CA's
    roots to a subsequent release.

 

> [!NOTE]
> * Microsoft will determine at its sole discretion which CA certificates are included the Program.
> * Microsoft will not charge any fee for including a CA's certificates in the Program.
> * Microsoft reserves the right to not include a CA in the Program for any reason or no reason at all
