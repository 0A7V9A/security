# Release notes for Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program

The Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program releases changes to our Root Store on a monthly cadence, except for December. The public can expect the following cadence for releases: 
1.	Additions and non-deprecating modifications will be completed any month
2.	Certificate Authority (CA)-initiated and CA-confirmed deprecations will occur on even numbered months
3.	Microsoft-initiated deprecations will occur in February and August releases

If you are a certificate user who has active certificates chaining up to a deprecating root,  please reach out to your CA to understand how changes may impact your certificates. 
Update packages will be available for download and testing at <http://ctldl.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/v3/static/trustedr/en/test/authrootstl.cab> 

Please note, the changes listed are accurate at the time of posting but are subject to change.

A list of Root Store participants, updated monthly, can be found here: <http://aka.ms/trustcertpartners>.
