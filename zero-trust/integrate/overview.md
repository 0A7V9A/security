# Integrate with Microsoft's Zero Trust solutions

Today, organizations need a new security model that effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located.

The Zero Trust journey will look unique for every organization that implements it. At Microsoft, we understand that our customers use products that work well for them, and so we strive to meet them where they are.

For this reason, we want to support technology partners so that they can integrate their own solutions with ours. The integration guidance in this section is organized by Zero Trust technology pillar. This guidance is for software providers and technology partners who want to enhance their security solutions and reach new customers by integrating with Microsoft products.
