# Modernize security operations

The other top priority initiative that you can run in parallel to user access and productivity is the modernization of security operations. This focuses on threat detection, response, and recovery capabilities for new cloud applications, remote devices, identities, and other assets outside of the traditional security perimeter, complementing the preventive access controls. 

Modernizing security operations with Zero Trust requires rigorous prioritization to ensure that SecOps teams are focused on the greatest risk to the organization, arenâ€™t wasting time on false alarms and positives, and have the broad and deep visibility across the entire estate they need to be effective. 

Continue your [Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)](zero-trust-ramp-overview.md#ramp-initiatives-for-zero-trust) deployment with these steps:

4. [Streamline responses](modernize-security-operations-streamline-response.md)
 
5. [Unify visibility](modernize-security-operations-unify-visibility.md)

6. [Reduce manual effort](modernize-security-operations-reduce-manual-effort.md)
