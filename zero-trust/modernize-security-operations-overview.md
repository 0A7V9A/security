# Modernize security operations

The other top priority initiative that you can run in parallel to user access and productivity is the modernization of security operations. This focuses on threat detection, response, and recovery capabilities for new cloud applications, remote devices, identities, and other assets outside of the traditional security perimeter, complementing the preventive access controls. 

Modernizing security operations with Zero Trust requires rigorous prioritization to ensure that SecOps teams are focused on the greatest risk to the organization, aren’t wasting time on false alarms and positives, and have the broad and deep visibility across the entire estate they need to be effective. 

3. [Streamline responses](modernize-security-operations-streamline-response.md)
 
   The first priority for SecOps is to master threat response and remediation on commonly attacked resources using Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology provide high quality alerts for these new resource types, bypassing the manual effort and delays when trying to build every alert in a security information and event management (SIEM). 

   Streamlining the processes for these common attacks. Focusing the triage (Tier 1) and investigation (Tier 2) analyst teams on mastering these attacks will catch both commodity and advanced attackers earlier in the process, reducing risk to the organization. 
 
4. [Unify visibility](modernize-security-operations-unify-visibility.md)

   While it’s difficult to create high-quality individual alerts from raw data in SIEMs, they are very useful for bringing all the data and context together for investigations and for threat hunting. 

   This provides you a broad view across your entire estate and reduces blind spots where attackers may dwell. 

5. [Reduce manual effort](modernize-security-operations-reduce-manual-effort.md)

   At all times, security operations should be focused on reducing the toil and suffering from manual and repetitive tasks such as switching tools, typing commands, and copying and pasting data. 

   Focusing on giving analysts a streamlined end-to-end integrated experience with Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) technology will increase both effectiveness and morale. SOAR technology is built into both Microsoft 365 Defender and Azure Sentinel.
