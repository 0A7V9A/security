# Step 1: Add SaaS apps to Azure Active Directory and apply MFA



Register apps in Azure Active Directory so that you can monitor and configure applications in the cloud. Azure Active Directory also includes an application gallery which is a collection of SaaS apps that have been pre-integrated with Azure AD. 

When an application is registered in Azure AD, you'll have control over which users can securely access resources.  

After adding apps to Azure AD, you can further restrict how apps are accessed by including these apps in the scope of your multi-factor authentication and conditional access policies.
