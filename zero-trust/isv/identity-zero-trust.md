# Building identity solutions for Zero Trust

:::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-identity-medium.png":::

Identities define the Zero Trust control plane. They represent the people, services, or IoT devices that are accessing your resources. Creating identity solutions will help customers rapidly improve their security posture by controlling who has access to resources and what they have access to.

The integrations in this section help to create solutions to verify identities with strong authentication, and ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity, follow least privilege access principles by providing the smallest scope of access necessary, and securing access to legacy applications that are not capable of providing this level of security on their own.
