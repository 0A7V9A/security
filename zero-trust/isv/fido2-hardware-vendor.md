# Become a FIDO2 harware partner

81% of hacking related breaches used either stolen or weak passwords. It's common practice for IT to attempt lessening password risk by employing stronger password complexity and demanding more frequent password changes. However, these tactics drive up IT help desk costs while leading to poor user experiences related to password reset requirements.

FIDO2 security keys offer a solution. A security key can entirely replace weak, static username/password credentials with strong hardware-backed public/private-key credentials. These credentials cannot be reused, replayed, or shared across services. For shared device scenarios, security keys allow you to carry your credential with you and safely authenticate to an Azure AD joined Windows 10 device that's part of your organization.

Microsoft has been working with partners to ensure FIDO2 security devices work on Windows, the Microsoft Edge browser, and online Microsoft accounts, to enabling strong password-less authentication.

You can become a Microsoft Compatible FIDO2 Security Key Vendor through the following process.

1. First, your authenticator needs to have a FIDO2 certification. We will not be able to work with providers who do not have a FIDO2 certification. To learn more about the certification, please visit this website: [https://fidoalliance.org/certification/](https://fidoalliance.org/certification/)
2. After you have a FIDO2 certification, please fill in your request to our form here: [https://forms.office.com/r/NfmQpuS9hF](https://forms.office.com/r/NfmQpuS9hF). Our engineering team will only test compatibility of your FIDO2 devices. We won't test security of your solutions.
3. Once we confirm to move forward to the testing phase, the process usually take about 3-6 months. The steps usually involve:
  1. Initial discussion between Microsoft and your team.

    1. Verify FIDO Alliance Certification/path to certification if not complete.
    2. Overview of device from vendor
  1. Microsoft will share our test scripts with you. Our engineering team will be able to answer questions if you have any specific needs.
  2. You will complete and send all passed results to Microsoft Engineering team
  3. Once Microsoft confirms, you will send multiple hardware/solution samples of each device to Microsoft Engineering team
    1. Upon receipt Microsoft Engineering team will conduct;
      1. Test script verification
      2. User experience flow
  4. Upon successful passing of all tests by Microsoft Engineering team, Microsoft will confirm vendor's device is listed in [the FIDO MDS](https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/).
  5. Microsoft will add your FIDO2 Security Key on Azure AD backend and to our [list of approved FIDO2 vendors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless).
