# Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)

Today’s organizations need a new security model that more effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the hybrid workplace, and protects people, devices, apps, and data wherever they’re located. This new model includes:

- Productivity everywhere

  Empower your users to work more securely anywhere and anytime, on any device.

- Cloud migration

  Enable digital transformation with intelligent security for today’s complex environment.

- Risk mitigation

  Close security gaps and minimize risk of lateral movement.

Zero Trust operates on these security principles:

- Verify explicitly

  Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.

- Use least privileged access

  Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive polices, and data protection to help secure both data and productivity.

- Assume breach

  Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.


Here is the overall architecture for Zero Trust.

For every organization, the top priority Zero Trust RaAMP pillars are:

- [User Access and Productivity](user-access-productivity-overview.md)
- Modernize Security Operations

Zero Trust RaMP pillars based on need for the use of Operations Technology (OT) and Industrial IoT, on-premises cloud adoption, and security for in-house app development are:

- OT and Industrial IoT
- Datacenter & DevOps Security

## Next step

Begin your Zero Trust deployment journey with the [User Access and Productivity](user-access-productivity-overview.md) pillar.
