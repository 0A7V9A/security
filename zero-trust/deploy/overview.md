# Deploying Zero Trust solutions

Today, organizations need a new security model that effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located.

This is the core of **Zero Trust**. Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to "never trust, always verify."

Organizations may differ in terms of where they are in the Zero Trust journey. The Zero Trust Guidance Center aims to provide various options to implement the framework depending on what stage you're in.
