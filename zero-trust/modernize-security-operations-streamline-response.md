# Step 3. Streamline response

Your SecOps must master threat response and remediation on commonly-attacked resources using Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technology provide high quality alerts for these new resource types, bypassing the manual effort and delays when trying to build every alert in a security information and event management (SIEM) solution. 

Streamlining the processes for these common attacks and focusing the triage (Tier 1) and investigation (Tier 2) analyst teams on mastering these attacks will catch both commodity and advanced attackers earlier in the process, reducing risk to the organization. 

### Program and project member accountabilities

This table describes the implementation of an XDR in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.

| Lead | Owner | Accountability |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|
|  CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity Security | | Executive sponsorship |
| Program lead from SecOps Leadership| | Drive results and cross-team collaboration |
| | Security Architect  | Advise on configuration and standards |
| | SecOps Analysts | Implement configuration changes |
| | SecOps Analysts | Update standards and policy documents |
| | Security Governance | Monitor to ensure compliance |
