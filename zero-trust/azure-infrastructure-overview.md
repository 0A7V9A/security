# Secure Azure infrastructure with Zero Trust

This series of articles helps you apply the principles of Zero Trust to your workloads in Azure. These articles take a multi-disciplinary approach to applying the principles. This work is broken into units of work that can be configured together: 
- Azure Storage 
- Virtual machines (VMs) 
- Spoke Vnet for VM-based workloads  
- Hub Vnet to support access to many workloads in Azure 

Zero Trust is a security strategy. It is not a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles: 
- Verify explicitly 
- Use least privilege access 
- Assume breach 

Zero Trust is a mindset shift to “never trust, always verify” and will require changes to cloud infrastructure, deployment strategy, and implementation.
