## Strategy

Implementing a Zero Trust strategy can be a complex undertaking and an iterative process. It's important to clearly define the goals for your organization so that you can prepare the required resources and to achieve the goal of moving from a model of implicit trust to explicit verification. 


## Architecture

A Zero Trust architecture must be centered around the principles of assuming breach, using least privileged access, and verifying requests explicitly. 

A holistic approach to Zero Trust should extend to your entire digital estate - inclusive of identities, endpoints, network, data, apps, and infrastructure. Zero Trust architecture serves as a comprehensive end-to-end strategy and requires integration across the elements.

## Implementation
After creating a strategy and architecture, you can then proceed to advance your security infrastructure by implementing the plan. Depending on where your organization is in its Zero Trust journey, implementing a Zero Trust strategy may require a multi-stage approach to achieve a state of optimal maturity.


## Operation
Operations play a critical role in making sure that an organization's assets are protected. Learn how to use Zero Trust principles to apply in your operations, including people, processes, and technology.

Building a modern security operation requires modernization of incident response, increase coverage across infrastructure, apps, data, and more, including multi-tool operations. It also requires advanced functions and tooling. 

 
## Best practices

Find resources that provide clear actionable guidance for security related decisions. This guidance is presented in a series of videos and slides and are designed to help you increase your security posture and reduce risk whether your environment is cloud-only, or a hybrid enterprise spanning cloud(s) and on-premises data centers. 


## Learning

Learn new skills and discover concepts centered on Zero Trust principles.
