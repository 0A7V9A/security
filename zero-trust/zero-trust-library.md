## Strategy

Implementing a Zero Trust strategy can be a complex undertaking and an iterative process. It's important to clearly define the goals for your organization so that you can prepare the required resources and to achieve the goal of moving from a model of implicit trust to explicit verification. 


## Architecture

A Zero Trust architecture must be centered around the principles of assuming breach, using least privileged access, and verifying requests explicitly.
