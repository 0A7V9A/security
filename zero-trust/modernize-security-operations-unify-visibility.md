# Step 5. Unify visibility

NOTE TO REVIEWERS: This article is in progress and not ready for technical review.

While it’s difficult to create a high-quality individual alerts from raw data in security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, they are extraordinarily useful for bringing all the data and context together for investigations and for threat hunting, allowing for a broad view across your entire estate, reducing blind spots where attackers may dwell.

### Program and project member accountabilities

This table describes the implementation of a central SIEM alaysis in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.

| Lead | Owner | Accountability |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|
|  CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity Security | | Executive sponsorship |
| Program lead from SecOps Leadership| | Drive results and cross-team collaboration |
| | Security Architect  | Advise on configuration and standards |
| | SecOps Analysts | Implement configuration changes |
| | SecOps Analysts | Update standards and policy documents |
| | Security Governance | Monitor to ensure compliance |

### Deployment objectives

Meet these deployment objectives to unify visibility in your SecOps for Zero Trust.

NOTES: Setting up SIEM:  This section will contain the deployment objectives and technical deployment instructions for Microsoft Sentinel (previously Azure Sentinel). This step “levels up” in maturity from XDR, as now we can gather events from multiple sources and contextualize / cross-reference them.

TBD:
