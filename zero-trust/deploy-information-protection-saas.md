# Step 3: Deploy information protection for SaaS apps
 

While protecting access to apps and session activities are important, the data that SaaS apps access may be the most critical resource that must be protected. Deploying information protection for SaaS apps is a key step in preventing inadvertent exposure of sensitive information.


Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is part of Microsoft Purview Information Protection and delivers on the required information protection for SaaS apps. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps lets you automatically apply sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection. These labels will be applied to files as a file policy governance action, and depending on the label configuration, can apply encryption for additional protection.


By integrating Microsoft Purview Information Protection into Defender for Cloud Apps, you can use the full power of both services and secure files in your cloud, including:

- Applying sensitivity labels as a governance action to files that match specific policies
- Viewing all classified files in a central location
- Conduct investigations according to classification level, and quantify exposure of sensitive data over your cloud applications
- Creating policies to make sure classified files are being handled properly
