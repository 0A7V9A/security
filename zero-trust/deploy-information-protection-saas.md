# Step 3: Deploy information protection for SaaS apps

Deploying information protection for SaaS apps is a key step in preventing inadvertent exposure of sensitive information. While protecting access to apps and session activities are important, the data that SaaS apps access may be the most critical resource that must be protected.  Data exfiltration is typically a malicious attacker's main objective and often times the last stage of an attack.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Purview Information Protection and delivers on the required information protection for SaaS apps.  


Microsoft Purview Information Protection helps you discover, classify, and protect sensitive information.
