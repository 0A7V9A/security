# Step 3: Deploy information protection for SaaS apps 
 

While protecting access to apps and session activities are important, the data that SaaS apps access may be one of the most critical resources that must be protected. Deploying information protection for SaaS apps is a key step in preventing inadvertent exposure of sensitive information.

This solution builds on the Microsoft Information Protection solution guidance and guides you on how to use Defender for Cloud Apps to extend information protection to data in SaaS apps.

To protect data in SaaS apps, you must first identify and classify data. To identify your data, you need to define what is considered to be sensitive information for your organization. You can define sensitive information using the Microsoft Purview Information Protection portal and create sensitive information types and labels. Defender for Cloud Apps is natively integrated with Microsoft Purview Information Protection and the same sensitive types and labels are available throughout both services after they are created.


After identifying and classifying your data, you can then proceed to protect your data by applying sensitivity labels out to SaaS apps. 


To prevent data loss, you can create and apply data loss prevention (DLP) policies protection actions that such as encryption, access restrictions, and other actions. 


Use the following steps to guide you in using Microsoft 365 products so that you can apply information protection capabilities on SaaS apps:


|Step  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|1     |  Discover and classify sensitive data in SaaS apps       |
|2     |  Apply sensitivity labels to SaaS apps   |
|3     |  Extend DLP policies to cloud apps |
