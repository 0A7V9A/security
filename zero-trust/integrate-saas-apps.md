# Integrate SaaS apps for Zero Trust with Microsoft 365 overview


The way people work has dramatically evolved in the last couple of years. The widespread adoption of remote work has created a shift in the way people access corporate resources. This shift has undeniably highlighted the importance of having access to cloud-based apps. Software-as-a-service (SaaS)  plays a key role in fulfilling this demand, ensuring that applications and resources are available and accessible from any device with an Internet connection.


To ensure that access and productivity is secure, implementation of SaaS needs to align with the Zero Trust security model which is based on these guiding principles:

- Verify explicitly
Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. This is where Zero Trust identity and device access policies are crucial to sign-in and ongoing validation.

- Use least privilege access
Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.

- Assume breach
Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

Microsoft 365 helps you manage your SaaS applications giving you control and optics to discover and manage apps your users interact with.
