# Step 1. Explicitly validate trust for all access requests

This step includes using Zero Trust to explicitly validate trust for all access requests for:

- User Accounts

  Require Passwordless or MFA for all users + measure risk with threat intelligence & behavior analytics

- Devices

  Require device integrity for access (configuration compliance first, then XDR signals)


## User accounts
